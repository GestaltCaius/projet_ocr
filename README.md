# Neural network
* Khoyo and Theobs

# Character segmentation, Filters
* Loup Federico and zboubinours

# User Interface (GTK)

# Bugs/Not working
* GTK crashes after displaying the result
* Segmentation is not fully completed
* It happens that the semgnetation used in the "Soutenance finale" does not frame correctly. It should be fixed with the new segmentation functions that are not fully done yet
* Neural network recognizes only 2 fonts
